##Kinetics Problems

This is a series of online tools that I use when teaching pharmacy students pharmacokinetics.   You can see a demo [here](http://bitly.com/theilmankinetics).   

*Note:  Please don't send your students to my demo.   I'm paying for the traffic it gets.  If you want to use the software, please deploy a copy on your own server*

I noticed that first year pharmacy students had difficulty with word problems that contained more information than was needed.  For example, I once included a molecular weight in a pharmacokinetic problem in a homework assignment.   The next day, the student came up to me and asked how to work the molecular weight into the equations.   I told her that the molecular weight wasn't needed to answer the question.

She looked at me like I slapped her mother.

*I spent...two hours...trying to find an equation that included concentrations, time and molecular weight!*

The problem is that students sometimes work backwards.   They look at what information is presented in the problem and then try to find an equation that has those elements.    This often works for them because *writing word problems is hard*.   There's a tendency on the part of the faculty member to include just enough information to solve the problem.   Making up a bunch of details about the patient that aren't necessary takes time and effort.

So, one thing this tool does is it creates random patient cases.   Every time the student clicks "refresh" on their browser, the case is different.   What I am trying to do is teach them to figure out what information they need *first*.   It also helps students (who haven't yet been on experiential rotations) where they might find that information in the medical record.
