                    <p>
                        Looking back at our question, we see that it is asking for a glomerular filtration rate.
                        That's a measure of how fast the kidneys can filter blood.
                        The usual way of expressing GFR is <b>mL/minute</b>.
                        When directly measuring creatinine clearance using a 24-hour urine, we would cross out units in
                        order to end up with <b>mL/min</b>. However, units don't cross out when using the MDRD
                        equation. Rather, we have to make sure we are using the same units that they did when they
                        created the equation. We have to express
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serum creatinine in mg/dL</li>
                        <li>BUN in mg/dL</li>
                        <li>Serum albumin in g/dL</li>
                        <li>Weight in kg</li>
                        <li>Age in years</li>
                    </ul>
                    If we don't use those units, our number will not come out right.

                    <p>
                        We know that a 'typical' GFR is usually about 100 mL/min.
                        Some healthy, younger patients might have calculated GFRs of 125-150 mL/min.
                        A person in renal failure might have a GFR of less than 10 mL/min.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our answer is probably going to be somewhere between 0 - 150 mL/min.

                    Go back to Step 2. Does you answer look the way you expected it to?
                    Is the number in the same general range for the population predictions?</p>

                        Our answer was {{ CG | number: 0 }} mL/min,
                        which is somewhere in the range we expected. So it sounds right.

                        One thing to keep in mind is that this is an estimate of measured creatinine clearance, which
                        is itself an estimate of GFR. Confidence of the the estimate is decreased if the
                        patient is elderly, obese or has rapidly changing renal function.
                        So, if the patient is being treated with a drug with a
                        narrow therapeutic index or is critically ill, a 24-hour urine collection to measure actual
                        creatinine clearance would be advisable.
