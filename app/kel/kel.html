                        (time) and the Y-axis (concentration) are linear. Since {{drug.drug}} is a first-order drug,
                        we end up with a curved plot.

                        described in the case.

                        Curves are difficult to work with mathematically. Straight lines are easy. Changing the
                        Y-axis from linear to logarithmic changes the curves to straight lines. The important thing
                        to keep in mind is that the Y-axis no longer represents 'concentration'. It now represents
                        <b>ln concentration</b>. The X-axis (time) is still linear.

                    <p>
                        Looking back at our question, we see that it is asking for an elimination rate constant (Kel).
                        We know that the units for Kel is usually <b>per hour</b> (sometimes written as hr
                        <sup>-1</sup>
                        ).
                        If we cross out units and don't end up with <b>per hour</b>, we've done something wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are calculating this patient's elimination rate constant for {{drug.drug}}. We can look up
                        the
                        <a href="http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC175054&blobtype=pdf"
                           target="_blank">predicted value</a>
                        for the Kel of {{drug.drug}}. If our answer is not a number at least somewhat similar to the
                        population average, we've probably done something wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this case, we are expecting a number that is probably between 0.01 and 0.400. If we end up
                        with
                        our answer being "57" or "0.00000034", we need to go back and check our calculations.

                    It's hard to think in "per hours". It doesn't make intuitive sense to have a value with no units

                    It's also difficult to think in numbers less than one. Humans work best with numbers between

                    In order to better determine if the answer we got "makes sense", it may be helpful to convert the
                    Kel into half-life.

                    It's easier to think about {{PopulationParams.halflife | number:1}} hours rather than
                    {{PopulationParams.k}} per
                    hours. We can more easily understand that a half-life of {{PopulationParams.halflife | number:1}}
                    hours "makes sense" for {{drug.drug}} and gives us an intuitive appreciation of how quickly
                    the patient is eliminating {{drug.drug}}.
