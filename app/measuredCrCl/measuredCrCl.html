                    Creatinine is a waste product created by the natural turnover of muscle cells. It is almost
                    entirely eliminated via glomerular filtration. Very little of it undergoes active secretion
                    into the renal tubule or is reabsorbed from the tubule. Thus, seeing how quickly it gets
                    into the urine can give us a good estimate of the kidney's ability to filter blood.

                        In this process, we are looking at
                    <ul>
                        <li>How much creatinine is in the blood</li>
                        <li>How much of that creatinine comes out in the urine over time</li>
                    </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, what we are going to do is collect urine over a period of time. We will also collect a
                        blood sample. Ideally, the blood sample would be at the midpoint of the urine collection.
                        However, serum creatinine doesn't change that much over a period of a few hours, so the
                        timing of the blood sample is not critical.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After the urine collection is complete, the blood and the urine are sent to the lab. The lab
                        will measure how much creatinine there is in the two samples.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the kidneys are working well, a larger amount of creatinine should end up in the urine.
                        However, if the kidneys are not functioning, very little creatinine will end up in the urine.

                    <p>
                        Looking back at our question, we see that it is asking for a glomerular filtration rate.
                        That's a measure of how fast the kidneys can filter blood.
                        The usual way of expressing GFR is <b>mL/minute</b>.
                        If we cross out units and don't end up with <b>mL/min</b>, we've done something wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We also know that a 'typical' GFR is usually about 100 mL/min.
                        Some healthy, younger patients might have calculated GFRs of 125-150 mL/min.
                        A person in renal failure might have a GFR of less than 10 mL/min.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our answer is probably going to be somewhere between 0 - 150 mL/min.

                        Here is the general equation for a measured creatinine clearance. You can see that what we
                        are doing is comparing the concentrations of creatinine in the blood with the concentrations
                        that end up in the urine.

                    <p>
                        If most of the creatinine is staying in the blood, the kidneys must not be filterning very
                        well. If a lot of creatinine shows up in the urine, the kidneys must be filtering well.

                        The hardest part of using this equation is making sure that the units cross out correctly.
                        Always double check to see how the lab is reporting concentrations. They may not always
                        be using the same units as in this tutorial. That might require you to first convert between
                        mL, dL, mg or grams. The units for urine and blood concentrations need to be the same so that
                        they cross out.

                        Once we get the units of concentration to cancel out correctly, what left is <i>volume</i>
                        over <i>time</i>. We previously said we expected our answer to look like this, so that's a
                        good sign.

                        We can now start working on time. Note that we expect our answer to have <i>minutes</i> in the
                        denominator. We need to make sure that's what we use.

                    <p>
                        This test is sometimes referred to as a "24-hour urine". That's because we often collect
                        urine over a 24-hour period. However, there's nothing magical about "24 hours". The
                        collection period can be any length of time. Collecting urine over 24 hours will probably give
                        us a more accurate estimate of GFR than collecting over just 1-2 hours. But a 6-hour,
                        12-hour, or 36-hour urine collection would be calculated the same way. In our current case,
                        the urine was collected over {{Problem.durationUrineCollection | number:0}} hours.

                        While this is one of the more accurate ways of estimating GFR, it has a big drawback: We first
                        collected urine for {{Problem.durationUrineCollection | number:0}} hours.
                        If a patient comes in and needs drug therapy, we want to
                        figure out what dose to given them <b>now</b>, not in {{Problem.durationUrineCollection |
                        number:0}} hours.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And while we could have used a shorter urine collection period, that reduces the
                        accuracy of our result.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's why this technique is used much less frequently than using equations that estimate GFR
                        based on population averages. Using Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD you can estimte GFR using
                        just a blood sample. Neither technique is as good as getting a timed urine collection,
                        but the estimate is usually good enough to figure out a drug dose.
