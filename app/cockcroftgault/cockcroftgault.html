                        While getting a "24-hour urine" and measuring how quickly the patient excretes creatinine
                        would be optimal, it has one major drawback: It takes 24 hours. We need methods for
                        estimating the patient's glomerular filtration rate quickly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cockroft and Gault developed an equation that estimates GFR based on the patient's
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serum creatinine</li>

                    <p>
                        While it may not be the most accurate equation for estimating GFR, it can be done using paper
                        and pencil (no calculator needed). For most situations involving drug dosing, it is close
                        enough.

                        In this case, we know that the patient

                    <p>
                        Looking back at our question, we see that it is asking for a glomerular filtration rate.
                        That's a measure of how fast the kidneys can filter blood.
                        The usual way of expressing GFR is <b>mL/minute</b>.
                        When directly measuring creatinine clearance using a 24-hour urine, we would cross out units in
                        order to end up with <b>mL/min</b>. However, units don't cross out when using the Cockroft-Gault
                        equation. Rather, we have to make sure we are using the same units that they did when they
                        created the equation. We have to express
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serum creatinine in mg/dL</li>
                        <li>Weight in kg</li>
                        <li>Age in years</li>
                    </ul>
                    If we don't use those units, our number will not come out right.

                    <p>
                        We know that a 'typical' GFR is usually about 100 mL/min.
                        Some healthy, younger patients might have calculated GFRs of 125-150 mL/min.
                        A person in renal failure might have a GFR of less than 10 mL/min.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our answer is probably going to be somewhere between 0 - 150 mL/min.

                    <p>
                        The thing to keep in mind, though, is that Cockroft and Gault developed their equation using
                        data collected from patients whom we would consider "young" or "middle-aged" adults. They
                        didn't use data from many patients who were 70, 80 or 90 years old.

                        Let's think about the situation where we have a 90 year old man who weighs 50 kg with a serum
                        creatinine of
                        0.4 mg/dL. That's a low serum creatinine. Is his serum creatinine low because he has
                        super-performing kidneys?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Of course not. He has a very low creatinine because creatinine comes from muscle. He
                        doesn't have as much muscle mass as a man who is 35 years old. So, he won't be making as
                        much creatinine in the first place.

                        Some sources recommend ignoring the elderly patient's low actual serum creatinine and instead
                        using
                        1.0 mg/dL in the Cockroft-Gault equation for such a patient. The idea is that since the
                        patient's serum creatinine is "falsely low", arbitrarily increasing the creatinine will give us
                        a closer
                        estimate of the patient's actual GFR.

                            target="_blank">studies</a>
                        have suggested that this practice significantly <b>underestimates</b>
                        the patient's GFR. A <a
                            href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1592/phco.31.11.1130/abstract" target="_blank">position
                        paper</a>
                        published by ACCP calls rounding the serum creatinine to 1.0 mg/dL in elderly patients
                        "common, [but] is not evidence-based".

                    <p>
                        So, what does one do? Probably the best solution when dealing with such a patient
                        is to collect urine as soon as possible
                        and directly measure the patient's creatinine clearance. Until that result comes back, dosing
                        of drugs should use the elderly patient's actual serum creatinine in the Cockcroft-Gault
                        equation.
                        Then, the clinician should ask themselves:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            How toxic is the drug that I am giving?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How sick is the patient?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Which would do more harm: Overdosing the patient or undertreating the disease?
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        The answers to such questions are, of course, beyond the scope of this tutorial.

                        The other extreme would be children. The Cockcroft-Gault equation was not developed for use in
                        children and should not be used. There are other methods of estimating GFR in pediatric

                        The next thing to think about is weight. Creatinine is produced by muscle, not by adipose
                        tissue (fat). Looking at the Cockroft-Gault equation, it should be clear that using an obese
                        patient's body weight would give a higher estimate the patient's GFR than that of an
                        identical patient who was at their ideal body weight. It doesn't really
                        make sense to think that someone who is grossly obese would have better functioning kidneys.
                        Someone who is three times larger due to adipose tissue doesn't have three times larger
                        kidneys.

                        So, the question is "What should we put in for weight when the patient is obese?" When the
                        patient has BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the best
                        estimates of GFR seem to come from using a weight that reflects an obese person's
                        muscle mass rather than their actual body weight.

                        There have been several strategies proposed for trying to estimate this "lean" body weight.
                        This equation has been used most often to estimate "ideal body weight" in men.

                        The way this equation is used is that one subtracts 5 feet (60 inches) from the patient's
                        height. That number is multipled times 2.3. Then 50 kg is added.

                        In this case, the terms "ideal body weight" and "lean body weight" are being used
                        inter-changeably.
                        There really isn't anything "ideal" about IBW and a person who is above their IBW is not
                        necessarily obese. "Lean body weight" is probably a better name. However, most textbooks
                        and articles refer to that equation as "IBW", so that is what will be used here.

                        There are also <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165292/" target="_blank">other
                        ways</a>
                        of estimating "lean body weight", some of which might be more appropriate for certain drugs.

                    <p>
                        If the patient is underweight (actual weight < IBW), one would use their actual body weight
                        in the Cockcroft-Gault equation. One would not add kilograms that don't exist.

                            is included because when comparing a man and a woman of the same height and

                        One thing to keep in mind is that this is an estimate of measured creatinine clearance, which
                        is itself an estimate of GFR. Confidence of the the estimate is decreased if the
                        patient is elderly, obese or has rapidly changing renal function.
                        So, if the patient is being treated with a drug with a
                        narrow therapeutic index or is critically ill, a 24-hour urine collection to measure actual
                        creatinine clearance would be advisable.
