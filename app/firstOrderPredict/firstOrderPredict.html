                The patient has been receiving {{drug.drug}} {{firstOrderPredictProblem.dose}} mg every
                {{firstOrderPredictProblem.tau}} hours intravenously.
                The most recent dose was infused starting at {{firstOrderPredictProblem.InfusionBegin_time |
                date:'HH:mm'}} and
                the infusion was
                completed at {{firstOrderPredictProblem.InfusionEnd_time | date:'HH:mm' }}. The patient's elimination
                rate
                constant for {{drug.drug}}
                had previously been calculated as being {{firstOrderPredictPopulationParams.k}} per hour.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following concentration was collected:<br>

            <p>
                {{drug.drug}} ({{firstOrderPredictProblem.C0_time | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm'}})
                {{firstOrderPredictProblem.C0}} mg/L
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                Because of the supertherapeutic concentration, the {{drug.drug}} was stopped. The plan is to restart the
                {{drug.drug}}
                at a lower dose when the concentration reaches {{firstOrderPredictProblem.C}} mg/L.

                        This case is somewhat contrived in that one usually does not already know the elimination
                        rate constant for a specific patient. In a patient who has not yet had at least two
                        concentration collected, we usually have to rely on
                        <a href="http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC175054&blobtype=pdf"
                           target="_blank">predicted values</a>.
                        But let's say this is a patient that we had been consulted on previously and we have already
                        <a href="index.html#kel">calculated their Kel</a>.

                        Let your mouse rest over the various points on the graph to see what each one represents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even though there are several different points plotted, we really only know the concentrations
                        for
                        one (Co). The other points are just estimated based on what was described in the case.

                        So that we can work with straight lines rather than curves, we can plot the data on a semi-log
                        chart where the Y-axis is actually <b>ln concentration</b>.

                        Looking at this you might find
                        yourself saying "Dr. Theilman, I can see the point on the graph where
                        the concentration crosses {{firstOrderPredictProblem.C}} mg/L. We don't need to do all this
                        math, we can just read the answer off the graph!"

                    <p>
                        You are quite correct. As a matter of fact, before electronic calculators were available
                        that's how many people solved pharmacokinetic problems. They would plot the patient data on

                <ul>
                    <li>What is the answer going to look like?</li>

                        Looking back at our question, we see that it is asking for a <b>time of day</b>. The answer
                        that will result from our calculations will likely be in <b>hours</b>. If we answer in "hours",
                        we will not have completed the problem. Hours from when?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We also know that the answer will be sometime in the future. If we get a time of day that has
                        already passed, we've probably done something wrong.

                        Note that I didn't rearrange the equation to get â–³t by itself on the left-side of the

                        rearranged to put the "unknown" on the left. So, I'll be trying to use the same arrangement
                        of the equation consistently and will leave it to you to solve for whatever value is unknown.

                        The question is asking us for a <b>time of day</b>. The answer we calculated was
                        {{firstOrderPredictProblem.t2 | number:1}} <b>hours</b>. That's not what the question wanted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our answer indicates that we have to wait {{firstOrderPredictProblem.t2 | number:1}} hours.
                        Starting
                        when? When the infusion was started ({{firstOrderPredictProblem.InfusionBegin_time |
                        date:'HH:mm'}})?
                        Starting when the infusion ended ({{firstOrderPredictProblem.InfusionEnd_time | date:'HH:mm'}})?
                        Starting when we got the question ({{firstOrderPredictProblem.now | date:'HH:mm'}})?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Looking back at Step 3, we can see that we are counting hours starting from the time the
                        concentration
                        was drawn ({{firstOrderPredictProblem.C0_time | date:'HH:mm'}}). This is why I always recommend
                        drawing pictures. It makes it easy to go back and figure out what we are supposed to do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have to count {{firstOrderPredictProblem.t2 | number:1}} hours forward from
                        {{firstOrderPredictProblem.C0_time | date:'EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy h:mm a'}}.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The {{drug.drug}} concentration will fall to {{firstOrderPredictProblem.C}} mg/L at
                        {{goal_time | date:'EEEE, MMMM d, yyyy h:mm a'}}. That's when we can restart the {{drug.drug}}
                        at
                        a lower dose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Figuring out that dose is a different problem.
                    </p>
